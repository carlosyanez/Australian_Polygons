Data collection and preparation for [aussiemaps.data](https://github.com/carlosyanez/aussiemaps.data) R package.

The scripts in this repository download the Locality and LGA shapefiles from [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au) and Postal Area shapefiles from [ABS](https://abs.gov.au) and creates shapefiles that contain (LGA,Locality, Intersection) units. It also creates collections of territorial units to match regions.


At this stage, this only covers Australian internal states and territories.
